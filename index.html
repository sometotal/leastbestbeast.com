      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Least Best Beast is three guys making noise in the basement of a tattoo shop. Their influences include The Flaming Lips, Dinosaur Jr., Guided By Voices and Les Savy Fav (to name but a few). And while the notes that come blasting out feel familiar, it is still an original and fresh take on post-punk rock music.</p>

      <p>All three of them have been playing in bands since a young age. Patrick (bass) and Joe (guitar and vocals) were jamming together for a few months, but were having trouble finding a drummer. Most were lost to spontaneous combustion.</p>

      <p>Serendipitously, Mike (drums), had recently set up shop at Pat’s “Speakeasy Tattoo Studio” in Peekskill, NY. When Mike overheard Pat bitching about their search for a drummer, he didn’t miss a beat...  It was quickly apparent at the trio’s first session that it was a perfect fit and the beast was born.</p>
