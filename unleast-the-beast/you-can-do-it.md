# You Can Do It

You say that you wanna
You say that you can do it
You say that you wanna

No day is mañana
It’s today that you can do it
The day is upon us
Let’s go, let’s bust right through this

you can do it
you can do it

You say that you wanna
You say that you can do it
You say that you wanna
No one’s gonna help you through this

The way is with honor
The way that you can do it
No way left to follow
Where you’re going, no ones been through this

you can do it
