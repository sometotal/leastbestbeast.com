# (Guess What) Blind Date

Told you how to do it right
You just smirked and looked away
At least two times tonight
And three times earlier today Oh!

And then your friends say: “Let’s Go!”

I dont really want to fight
It doesn’t matter anyway
I can just say you’re right
Then you say “Stay the hell away” Oh!

And then your friends say: “Let’s Go!”
You know you wanna, why you running away?
All this for nothin, I’m just tryna explain
Why all the makeup, who you tryin to play?

Told you how to do it right
You just smirked and looked away
At least two times tonight
And three times earlier today

This is just your way of life
Its what you’re living everyday
But that just doesn’t make it right
It shouldn’t have to be this way!   Oh!

And then your friends say: “Let’s Go!”
You know you wanna, why you running away?
All this for nothin, I’m just tryna explain
Why all the makeup, who you tryin to play?

Told you how to do it right
You just smirked and looked away
At least two times tonight
And three times earlier today
