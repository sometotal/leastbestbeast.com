# Stutter Mutter

Satan’s coming along for the ride
Jesus is coming along for the ride

It’s taken way too long
We’re deep into the night
I guess I’m going along for the ride

It’s taken way too long
Stutter mutter the sounds
Da Da Da don’t sound right
It’s taken way too long for the ride

Emmy’s coming along for the ride
Mahoney’s coming along for the ride

It’s taken way too long
We’re deep into the night
I guess we’re all going along for the ride

It’s taken way too long
Stutter mutter the sounds
Da Da Da don’t sound right
I guess we’re all going along for the ride
