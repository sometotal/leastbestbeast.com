# Vulture Culture

You say you’re going to Frisco
To save the modern day
I hope your gusto esta listo
It’s gotta take you all the way

So damn wrong for so long
We’re gonna change it
So damn strong for so long
We’ve gotta change it

Charlottesville Virginia
Both sides are not to blame
It doesn’t take a thought militia
To make America great again
