# Hey You

Hey you    Where you going?
Later on
When you stay you’re still gone
Its not what you say its what you want

Even when you stay you’re still gone
Its not what you say its what you want
1 & 1 is 2 is never wrong


Hey You    What’s the problem?
Are we done?
When you stay you’re still gone
Its not what you say its what you want

Even when you stay you’re still gone
Its not what you say its what you want
Sacrifice your favorite tree for fun

What -- A Waste -- Of Time
For the money, For the show, Le’ts Go-go
You set a precedent of who youre messin with Let’s Go

Hey You
Yeah You
What’s your problem
Are we done?
