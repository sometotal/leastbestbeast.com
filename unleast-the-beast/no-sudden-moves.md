# No Sudden Moves

You run away
You try to hide
Another way
We’ve got to find

Hey. So what. Why? Not. 
Right on time today or tonight

You run away
You want to die
You want a cage
You want a lie
You run a way
...No sudden moves
You try to hide
...For you and I
Another way
...Blank parade
We’ve got to find
...For us inside

Hey. So what. Why? Not. 
Right on time today or tonight

You run a way
...No sudden moves
You try to hide
...For you and I
Another way
...Blank parade
We’ve got to find
...For us inside
