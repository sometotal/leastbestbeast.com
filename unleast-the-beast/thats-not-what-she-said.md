# That's Not What She Said

It's been way too long .. known each other since we were young
Can I stay too long .. I just wanna hear our song (come on)
I’m coming on way too strong
My head is all sorts of wrong
But we can say we will always know each other

Can’t wait too long .. I wanna see you again soon tomorrow
Its where I belong  .. wash away confusion and the sorrow
My head is all sorts of wrong
But I just can't wait too long
To wrap my ways and my world around another

Wicked soul
We can follow waves of sound
Fell way too high
Into fallen waste and fodder 
We can halve that hole
We may never know another
We can save this song
Dedicate it to our mother
Reconvene
Reconsider
Its been way too long
We may never know another

I ran away. I should have stayed and spent the night
That's not what she said
