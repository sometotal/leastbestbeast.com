look away<br>
smell so great<br>
resist my ways<br>
-- take me home<br>

make amends<br>
straighten these bends<br>
crack this lens<br>
-- make me whole<br>

crash my bike<br>
sink my life/boat<br>
steal our house<br>

      <h1>Satellite</h1>
      <p>
We'll take the spaceship today<br>
Way past Mars<br>
Way into space<br>
      </p>

      <p>
Could never wait til today<br>
You were far too bored<br>
To give us something so great<br>
      </p>

      <p>
The laser twitches<br>
It's got some glitches<br>
They should just take it away<br>
      </p>

      <p>
But you won't get far<br>
With no jet car<br>
They don't make em today<br>
      </p>

      <p>
We'll take the spaceship today<br>
Up to the stars<br>
We're blasting away<br>
      </p>

      <p>
Could never wait til the day<br>
You were too far<br>
Too bored to make it okay<br>
      </p>

      <p>
You lazy bitches<br>
You're so delicious<br>
You couldn't bake it away<br>
      </p>

      <p>
But with no jet car<br>
You won't get far<br>
Don't even make em today<br>
      </p>

      <p>
The satellites<br>
Up in the sky<br>
The satellites<br>
For you and I<br>
      </p>

      <p>
The satellites of today<br>
They couldn't make it okay<br>
They couldn't take us away<br>

      <h1>Waltz Waltz</h1>
      <p>
This song's at the end of its rope<br>
And she's made the call<br>
The troops are at the top of the hill<br>
And the wagons are our wall<br>
      </p>

      <p>
Seal the lake<br>
Tear down the wall<br>
Take this poor little Indian girl<br>
To spare us all<br>
      </p>

      <p>
Take this poor little Indian girl from home away from here<br>
And when you stand then she must fall<br>
      </p>

She still calls<br>
From Europe within<br>
She bleeds eternally<br>
For us all<br>
      </p>

      <p>
Take this poor little Indian girl from home away from here<br>
Fronm where he stands and she must fall<br>

Feel as if I'm really there<br>
But I don't care<br>
Push the parts together so damn hard<br>
Until they fall apart<br>
      </p>

      <p>
Second Best wont do<br>
No, not with you<br>
And this whole damn town is bringing me down<br>
I think I'll quit school<br>
      </p>

      <p>
Now we're back todgether<br>
When will it break down<br>
      </p>

      <p>
I know you and you know me too<br>
And I owe you but you owe me more<br>
So lets settle the score<br>
So we can do it all over again<br>

We'll go walk along the earth and deep into the night<br>
With a hand up to the light<br>
We may fall into the dirt, dig deeper without sight<br>
With a single slip tonight<br>
      </p>

      <p>
We will roll up to the club with a fever and a slug<br>
We’ll take down all the ones who pull out the rug on all of us<br>
We’ll take care of all our friends who’re on the mend or on the crutch<br>
Back to a place that we call home<br>
      </p>

      <p>
We'll feel it in our bones; stacked up to the sky<br>
That bends up to the light<br>
We'll hold the line all alone with our hands clenched tight<br>
On this city ship tonight<br>

Laundry fills the room<br>
My time is divided<br>
I'm Soldier Field<br>
I'm left here hiding<br>
      </p>

      <p>
Empty fills the room<br>
My time is decided<br>
I'm so confused<br>
I'm left here smiling<br>
So come down for a while<br>
I'll make you something to eat<br>
So we can talk about nothing and <br>
Fake a few smiles<br>
So come down for a while<br>
I'll make you something to eat<br>
And we can talk about nothing<br>
And fake a few smiles<br>
All I needed is to see you smile<br>

You come to the country<br>
And you blow them all away<br>
Got all your snotty phrases<br>
And you know just what to say<br>
You can call this British<br>
      </p>

      <p>
It’s getting scenic all the way<br>
It’s getting scenic all the way<br>
All across the bridges<br>
      </p>

      <p>
Pretty soon it all goes away<br>
And when the American public’s left in a daze<br>
Then whats left is a days worth of what you can take.<br>
The pretty brothers in a popular way<br>
      </p>

      <p>
It’s getting scenic all the way<br>
It’s getting scenic all the way<br>
All across the bridges<br>

      <p>
The power to take it<br>
Take it far away<br>
And when the British Invasion<br>
Blows you away<br>
You cannot fall it’ll take you to pieces<br>
You cannot fall, fall, fall, fall<br>

And more. Let's stay up all night<br>
Let's have a party, just me and you. Just us two<br>

I fell last night<br>
From your window<br>
I couldn't let it go<br>
      </p>

      <p>
I knew it from the moment that I met you<br>
From the moment that I asked you to be my girlfriend<br>
Like a schoolboy I was in love, a fool with a dog<br>
A star nosed mole in heavy fog<br>
I could see right through. I could find my way. I could waste a whole day just trying to bump into you<br>
      </p>

I fell last night<br>
From your window<br>

I know you won't believe me when I say<br>
I know you’ll probably roll your eyes<br>
But this I know is true<br>
You’re sofa king special that I have to swear, hand on heart and hand in the air<br>

      <h1>Twenty Miles Westward</h1>
      <p>
My dad and texans never mixed very well<br>
He said that they remember everything<br>
And when you lie they can tell<br>
My dad died in a penitentiary hell<br>
He said he'd cry when he made it<br>
Back home from his cell<br>
He said it could be a long way<br>
But from where he stood, he couldn't tell<br>
      </p>

      <p>
I go when the spirit moves me ahead<br>
I draft notes from the bank I leveled over the dead<br>
Years and years make falling circles<br>
Leaves me feeling like death<br>
Finding a next thing<br>
Is only ahead<br>
      </p>

      <p>
God is Texas<br>
God is Texas<br>
      </p>

      <p>
My dad and texans never mixed very well<br>
He said they lied about everything<br>
And they were deprived of their sense of smell<br>
My dad's alive in a sentimental hell<br>
They say he cries about everything<br>
And when he laughed you couldn't tell<br>
      </p>
